*) How do I use it from the command line?

	Take a look at the pml script. You can say
	
		pml <some_pml_file>
		
	and it will output the processed text to standard out.
	
*) How do I use it from a perl script?

	use PML;
	
	my $pml = new PML;
	
	$pml->parse("/path/to/some/file.pml");
	my $text = $pml->execute;
	
*) How about something that is not so simple?

	Here is a sample PML file...
	
		<html>
		<head><title> ${title} </title></head>
		<body><h1> ${title} </h1></body>
		</html>
	
	And here is a sample perl script...
	
		use PML;
		
		my $pml = new PML;
		
		$pml->parse("my_pml_file.pml");
		my $text = $pml->execute({title => 'This is a test'});
		
	When you run this script this is what gets put into $text...
	
		<html>
		<head><title> This is a test </title></head>
		<body><h1> This is a test </h1></body>
		</html>

*) How do I get Apache to parse files that end in .pml?
	
	Take a look in the Apache subdirectory. There you will find
	some more information and the mod_pml Apache Module
